### TASK 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
### Author: Sharjeel
### Domain: Data Science


### Problem Statement

The Titanic tragedy of 1912 saw over 1,500 lives lost, with survival influenced by factors like age, gender, and passenger class. This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived based on their details, such as age, gender, fare, and class. By analyzing these factors, we seek to uncover survival patterns and develop an accurate prediction system while exploring key data science techniques.

### Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster based on their demographic and socio-economic features.

### Approach

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Model Testing will be implemented. We will analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors influencing survival and prepare it for modeling. Different machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, will be tried to identify the best fit for the survival prediction task.

### Content

The columns are resembling practical world features. The Survived column indicates 1 if survived else 0. The data has 12 features which helps us analyze if the person survived or not.
