### TASK 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
### Author: Sharjeel
### Domain: Data Science


### Problem Statement

The Titanic tragedy of 1912 saw over 1,500 lives lost, with survival influenced by factors like age, gender, and passenger class. This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived based on their details, such as age, gender, fare, and class. By analyzing these factors, we seek to uncover survival patterns and develop an accurate prediction system while exploring key data science techniques.

### Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster based on their demographic and socio-economic features.

### Approach

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Model Testing will be implemented. We will analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors influencing survival and prepare it for modeling. Different machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, will be tried to identify the best fit for the survival prediction task.

### Content

The columns are resembling practical world features. The Survived column indicates 1 if survived else 0. The data has 12 features which helps us analyze if the person survived or not.

### TASK 2: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
### Author: Sharjeel
### Domain: Data Science


### Problem Statement

Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.

### Aim

The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

### Approach

we will read the dataset and preprocess by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables appropriately. Feature engineering will be performed to enhance the model's performance, including creating new features and removing irrelevant ones. The dataset will then be split into training and testing sets, and Linear Regression model will be trained. Finally, the model's accuracy will be evaluated using metrics like MSE, MAPE or R_Square.

### Content

The columns are resembling practical world features. The Rating column indicates ratings are likely scaled between 1 and 10, with higher ratings indicating better reviews or preferences. In the Rating column we have ratings and the frequency of the ratings. Data contains 15509 records and 10 distinct features.

### TASK 3: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
### Author: Sharjeel
### Domain: Data Science

### Problem Statement

With the increasing reliance on digital payment systems, credit card transactions have become a primary target for fraudulent activities. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is critical for ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of financial systems. However, the challenge lies in distinguishing legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones, given the high volume of data, imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, and the constantly evolving tactics of fraudsters.

### Aim

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

### Approach

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging historical transaction data, the model will identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud while minimizing false positives to avoid inconvenience to genuine customers. The model's success will be evaluated based on its ability to enhance fraud detection rates, improve precision and recall, and provide actionable insights for financial institutions.

### Content
The columns are resembling practical world features. Data contains 284807 rows and 31 features. Feature 'Class' is the target variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
